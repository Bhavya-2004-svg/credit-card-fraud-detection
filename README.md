Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing unauthorized transactions made using stolen credit card information. It involves analyzing transaction patterns to flag suspicious activity, such as unusual spending, geographic inconsistencies, or odd transaction times. 

**Key techniques include:**
- **Machine learning**: Models like random forest classification
- **Real-time monitoring**: Transactions are assessed as they occur, with actions like blocking the transaction or notifying the cardholder.
- **Data features**: Amount, merchant, time, location, and transaction frequency are key indicators.
- **Fraud prevention methods**: Multi-factor authentication, tokenization, and CVV verification help reduce fraud risk.

The goal is to protect consumers, businesses, and financial institutions from losses while minimizing false positives.
